Overview:
Raid Squad Builder is a personal companion app for Pokémon GO players. It helps users build their most effective raid teams based on the Pokémon they already own.

Core Features:
	•	Pokémon Importing: Users can manually enter, paste, or OCR-scan their collection data (e.g., from apps like Calcy IV or Poke Genie).
	•	Team Builder: Select a raid boss or type (e.g., Dragon, Psychic, Fire), and the app recommends the optimal 6-Pokémon team based on the user’s current roster.
	•	Effectiveness Scoring: Each Pokémon is ranked by type effectiveness and overall raid performance using public battle formulas (like DPS and TDO).
	•	Roster Management: View, sort, and filter all imported Pokémon by type, CP, IV, and performance rank.
	•	Optional Inputs: Adjust team recommendations for weather boosts, mega evolutions, and friendship bonuses.

Platform:
Mobile app (React Native or Flutter). Designed for personal use — no backend or online multiplayer components required.

Compliance:
Built using user-provided data and public game mechanics. No memory reading, no spoofing, and no API calls to Pokémon GO.
